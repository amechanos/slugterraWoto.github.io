Tjulyurpa pulpa-ku kanyilpai. They will watch the wall. That was the motive of the Kura family. For centuries, the Kura family had kept secret of the lands and waterways beneath Australia, watching over not only the world above, but also the walls. The traditional owners of the lands and waterways of the mystical underground of Slugterra were divided, for a massive, uncontrollable desert scorching most of the area below the burning world. The lands were more than the typical spectacle, for 4 regions circulating what seemed to be an encased desert. It was home to more than just humans, but also moles, trolls, amphibians and especially slugs. Stories had to end at some point, and new journeys would start. Time would always meet fate and whatever came next, was inevitable.

“Iris, are you ready to be a watcher?” Iris scanned the ragged note on her desk, carried by a hoverbug. “So dad thinks I'm ready?” 

The hoverbug happily hopped up and down, enticing Iris even further. She stood up with exhilaration, a surge of adventure pulsing within her mind. She was finally going to be able to go to Slugterra, a place where her mum had told her legends and stories about. Some of her favourites were about how a tribe of Aboriginals discovered Slugterra and hid from the invading British people. It sounded like a place where she could finally see the truth and deep cultures and histories of the world beneath her feet.

The smooth sandstone shifted easily, and as Iris climbed down, she didn't look back up. She knew that once she committed herself to journey down to Slugterra, there was no easy way out, coming back to the burning world. “I can't believe I'm becoming a watcher\!”
